# Interview Scheduler

## About the Project
  This project focuses on concepts specifically related to React. We learned the different ways React can be used to update the DOM, and learned how to build a website based on components. We also learned about the importance of state and the different ways it can be used to update information on the page. This project was done in a week and a half, and a big chunk of the project focused specifically on testing, using tests such as Jest for unit testing and Cypress for more integrated testing. The project put a large emphasis on the importance of testing, and it taught me that testing is a vital part in the coding process. Overall, an enjoyable project that was challenging and difficult, revealing the limitless possibilities of using React.
